# Image Helper

Formarly, this was [Markdown Image Helper](https://github.com/bigyuki/markdown-image-helper) inspired by [markdown-assistant](https://github.com/knightli/markdown-assistant)

This Atom package creates a directory named `assets`, store the image as a png file in it, and insert a relative image path in the document. Documents can be in markdown, HTML or else. The name of the directory can be changed in the Atom setting.

## Usage

1. Take a screenshot or copy any image to the clipboard.
2. Paste it into Atom editor
